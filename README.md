A simple, user-friendly tool that converts Apple HEIC photos to standard JPEG format while preserving maximum quality. Perfect for sharing photos with friends, family, or services that don't support the HEIC format.

## üì∏ What This Tool Does

Apple devices save photos in HEIC format, which gives excellent quality with smaller file sizes. However, many applications, websites, and non-Apple devices don't support this format. This tool solves that problem by:

- Converting HEIC photos to standard JPEG format
- Preserving the highest possible quality
- Maintaining folder structure
- Processing multiple files in parallel for speed
- Creating a separate output folder that keeps your original files untouched

## üõü Troubleshooting

- **"No module named 'pillow_heif'"**: The script should automatically install required libraries, but if it doesn't, run `pip install pillow pillow-heif pathlib` manually
- **"No HEIC files found"**: Make sure you're pointing to the correct directory and that the files have .HEIC extension
- **Windows shows errors with colors**: The colored text might not display correctly in some Windows terminals
